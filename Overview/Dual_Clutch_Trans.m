%% Dual Clutch Transmission
%
% This example shows a vehicle with a five-speed automatic dual-clutch
% transmission. The transmission controller converts the pedal deflection
% into a demanded torque. This demanded torque is then passed to the engine
% management. The pedal deflection and the vehicle speed are also used by
% the transmission controller to determine when the gear shifts should
% occur. Gear shifts are implemented via the two clutches, one clutch
% pressure being ramped up as the other clutch pressure is ramped down.
% Gear pre-selection via dog clutches ensures that the correct gear is
% fully selected before the on-going clutch is enabled.
% 
% This model can be configured for fixed-step simulation, making it
% suitable for hardware-in-the-loop testing.
