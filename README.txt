Here are some key points about this demonstration model.

1. You must run "startup_DCT_Model.m" to set the path and load key values.

2. You will need a supported compiler.

3. DCT_Model_Demo_Script.html will walk you through most parts of the wind turbine demo.  

6. This version will only run with R2011a and higher due to the SimDriveline content.
